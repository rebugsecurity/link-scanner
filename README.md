# link-scanner
This tool will scan any link/URL that you provide it, and it will scan it to see if it is still active or not active at all! It's great to know if a site/link is active before even visiting it on your own, so I've made this tool for you all!

# installing requirements
``pip3 install requests``

# usage
``python3 scan.py`` then provide a link when prompted.
